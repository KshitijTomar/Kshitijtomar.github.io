It is further submitted that in its Circular dated 09.08.2005 the University Grants Commission (“UGC” for</SPAN></P>

<P class="p95 ft2">“In the course of hearing of these cases we noticed that the UGC even though impleaded as a party respondent had not filed any counter affidavit. We would have proceeded with the hearing even in the absence of a counter affidavit but for the fact that additional documents filed by Respondent No.1 include several documents concerning the UGC some of them in the nature of letters, circulars and communications addressed to several other authorities. It was in that backdrop that we required the personal presence of the Chairman of the UGC, Professor Ved Prakash who has appeared and broadly explained the UGC stand on the questions that fall for determination. According to Professor Ved Prakash the UGC recognises technical degrees by the distant mode only if the University concerned awards such degrees after obtaining the permission of the AICTE for offering such degrees/courses by distance education. Professor Ved Prakash further states that wherever the UGC notices that technical educational degrees are being awarded by deemed university without the approval of the AICTE, it can and does take action against the defaulting university by reporting the matter to the Central Government who confers the status of deemed university on such institutions. When asked whether Professor Ved Prakash can on affidavit state the above position, Prof. Prakash was more than willing to do so. Needless to say some of the counsel appearing in these cases were critical of the stand taken by the UGC and argued that the same was not the true position either on facts or in law. Be that as it may, we deem it just and proper to permit the UGC to file a detailed counter affidavit to this SLP which shall apart from answering other submissions made in the SLP elaborate on the following aspects:</P>
<P class="p96 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">1)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft23">Whether the UGC recognises degrees in technical education by open and distance education mode. If so, subject to what conditions, if any.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p97 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">2)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft24">If such degrees are recognised only when they are awarded after obtaining the permission of the AICTE, what happens when the Universities award degrees without obtaining such permission.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p99 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">4)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft24">Whether the Government of India have issued any instructions/circulars regarding recognition of technical education degrees through ODL mode offered by the deemed or statutory universities.

<P class="p103 ft2">“There are a large number of cases pending on the</P>
<P class="p104 ft29">principal issue raised in SLP (C) <NOBR>Nos.19807-19808</NOBR> of 2012 (Orissa Lift Irrigation Corporation Ltd. & Ors.). Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that the principal issue is whether degrees given by some institutions/universities through distant education ought to be recognized by the employer. He submits that All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and University Grants Commission (UGC) have taken the stand that such degrees in technical courses are not recognized by AICTE and therefore not recognized by UGC as well.</P>
<P class="p105 ft2">Mr. Rajiv Dutta, learned senior counsel appearing for UGC affirms that the UGC does not recognize the degrees. It is the submission of Mr. Rajiv Dutta, learned senior counsel that in a meeting convened by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on 19th February, 2008 it was decided that the approval granted by Distant Education Council (including ) must be reviewed and the approval should be granted to the courses and not to the Institute.</P>
<P class="p106 ft29">That being the position, we are of the opinion that the concerned Secretary in the MHRD should be impleaded as a party so that the stand of the Government of India is clear.</P>
<P class="p107 ft30">Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel makes an oral request for impleadment of the concerned Secretary in the MHRD as a party respondent. On his oral request, the concerned Secretary in the MHRD is impleaded as a party</P>

<P class="p127 ft2">Yet, three institutions- Deemed to be Universities (namely, JRN Vidyapeeth Udaipur, Rajasthan; IASE Gandhi Vidya Mandir, Sardarshahr, Rajasthan; and Allahabad Agriculture Research Institute, Allahabad, U.P.) overstepped their mandate and started distance education programmes, including for award of B.E./B.Tech degrees outside their field of specialization without UGC/AICTE approval.</P>
<P class="p95 ft2">Secondly, vide letter dated 09.08.2001 [annexed and excerpted later in the instant affidavit], the UGC has made it clear that franchising of education through private agencies/establishment is not permitted. In addition, the UGC, AICTE and DEC have issued a joint letter dated 13.05.2003 [annexed and excerpted later in the instant affidavit] to Vice- Chancellors/Heads of Institutions asking them to limit the system/programme of delivery of distance education of their institution to the neighbourhood of the location of their main</P>

<P class="p128 ft2">campus or at the most within the State. And, as mentioned earlier, vide public notice dated 27.06.2013, the UGC has stated that institutions Deemed to be Universities can operate only within its headquarters or from those off <NOBR>campuses/off-shore</NOBR> campuses which are approved by the Government of India through notification published in the official gazette, though the UGC has not granted approval to any institutions Deemed to be Universities offered distance education mainly through franchisee arrangements and Study Centres which are not established with the permission of the UGC.”</P>
<P class="p129 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">12.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft44">The aforesaid chart shows that the “Deemed to be University” status</SPAN></P>
<P class="p82 ft2">was conferred keeping in view the potential to offer academic programs in</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">specific domains of knowledge. For example institutions at serial Nos.1 and</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">2 in the aforesaid table had specialized in Social Work, Education, Arts and</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">Commerce. However by virtue of their “Deemed to be University” status,</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">these institutions thereafter started distance education programs in subjects</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">or courses leading to award of B.E. and B.Tech degrees which were not</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">within their field of specialization. Whether the Deemed to be Universities</P>
<P class="p118 ft2">concerned were within their rights to do so is the basic question. We,</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">therefore, need to consider the statutory framework governing “Deemed to</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">be Universities” and ‘Distance Education’ more specifically in the field of</P>
<P class="p82 ft2">technical education.</P>

Section 3 contemplates conferral of “Deemed to be University” status upon certain institutions for higher studies other than universities. Section 12 delineates functions of the UGC while Section 13 deals with power of inspection for the purposes of ascertaining the financial needs of the university or its standards of teaching, education and research.</P>
<P class="p132 ft8">Section 26 empowers the UGC to make regulations consistent with the Act and with the Rules made thereunder which include, <SPAN class="ft46">inter alia</SPAN>:-</P>

<P class="p251 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">10.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft119">Then, in 2004, the UGC framed “Guidelines for</SPAN></P>

<P class="p349 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">13.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft54">……..Here, it may be briefly noted that the DEC had granted such </SPAN><NOBR>ex-post</NOBR> facto approval because, as per the</P>
<P class="p350 ft2">MHRD’s gazette notification No.44, dated 01.03.1995, qualifications were required to have mandatory approval of the DEC and, wherever necessary, AICTE to be valid for Central Government jobs. However, since the DEC started giving such approvals in <NOBR>2004-5</NOBR> and the proper mechanism could be put in place only in 2007, most universities/institutions were not recognized by the DEC though many universities were offering programmes through correspondence and distance mode even before the establishment of the DEC (or its policy for giving recognitions). As a result, many students who had obtained their qualifications through distance mode started facing problems because of <NOBR>non-recognition</NOBR> of their qualifications, including many who were in employment for years. Therefore, in order to safeguard the interest of these students, the DEC started the process of <NOBR>ex-post</NOBR> facto approvals and, consequently, many universities offering programmes through distance mode (including technical programmes) were accorded <NOBR>ex-post</NOBR> facto approval. However, the universities concerned were required to follow the norms of the appropriate regulatory bodies and seek their approval wherever required.)</P>

<P class="p350 ft2">The MoU was “aimed to avoid duplication of efforts in streamlining of activities” between the three bodies who had “mutually agreed to 1) carry out various functions of UGC & AICTE mandated under the Acts, as decided by the UGC and AICTE from time to time jointly with Distance Education Council to ensure coordinated and integrated development and maintenance of norms and standards of technical and general education through distance and mixed mode in any form and format in the country….” The Joint Committee was “to oversee the implementation of MoU and to design action plan for approval and monitoring of institutions offering technical programmes through distance and mixed mode” and applications for approval of programmes in distance and mixed mode in the field of technical and general education were to be submitted to the Secretary to the Joint Committee. …….</P>
<P class="p352 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">15.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft45">Therefore, since the AICTE was a member of the Joint Committee, the UGC considered approval from the Joint Committee as tantamount to approval from AICTE as well.

<P class="p353 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">17.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">In any event, vide letter dated 29.07.2009, the MHRD had informed the erstwhile DEC that the latter “should immediately withdraw permission given to various institutions to conduct B.Tech/B.E.

Those who have already been admitted will have to pass both practical and written examination as may be prescribed in this regard, so as to give validity to the B.Tech/B.E. degree acquired by them through distance education.” Accordingly, the erstwhile DEC had issued a letter dated 13.08.2009 stating that “the Joint</SPAN></P>
<P class="p355 ft2">Committee of <NOBR>UGC-AICTE</NOBR> and DEC has not yet accorded any approval to BE/B.Tech programme of any University offered through distance mode. Any such programmes offered by a University are hence illegal and are not approved by the DEC.

AICTE has the policy to consider only MBA and MCA through Distance Mode for its recognition.

<P class="p363 ft2">That it is submitted that in view of the position explained hereinabove, the conduct of a technical course through distance education mode other than a course in MBA and MCA is not permissible. Thus, any technical course conducted by the technical institutions including the institution Deemed to be university concerned through distance education mode, except a course in MBA and MCA, is contrary to the policy of the AICTE. Hence, degrees or diplomas in technical course through distance education mode other than a course in MBA and MCA awarded by the technical institutions including the institution Deemed to be university cannot be treated valid degree or diploma.</P>
<P class="p107 ft29">That it is submitted that in the present matter, the Private Respondent has obtained degree in Engineering from JRN Rajasthan Vidyapeeth, an institution Deemed to be University, through Distance Education Mode and through study centers which is not permissible as per the policy of the AICTE.

<P class="p365 ft8"><SPAN class="ft2">26.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft39">DEC having been dissolved in May 2013, we do not have its stand on record but the stand of MHRD in its affidavit is to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P class="p366 ft2">“VII. I further submit that upto year 2007 Distance Education Council (DEC) used to give recognition to institution offering general courses in the distance mode but during that year, Distance Education Council (DEC) also started giving recognition to such institutions to conduct technical</P>
<P class="p348 ft2">programmes under the distance mode. This was in contradiction to policy adopted by AICTE which makes it</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_72">


<P class="p0 ft0">72</P>
<P class="p353 ft2">mandatory to conduct technical programmes through the regular (Conventional) mode of education. This created confusion amongst the stakeholders which gave unfair advantage to unscrupulous institutions conducting such courses in the distance mode. Accordingly, a Tripartite Committee of <NOBR>UGC-AICTE-DEC</NOBR> was constituted through an MOU in May, 2007 for a limited period of three years.</P>
<P class="p353 ft2">VIII. In the meantime, on 19.02.2008 a meeting of Secretary, Department of Higher Education, MHRD was held with the Heads of UGC, AICTE, IGNOU and Joint Secretary (DL) to discuss the issue of <NOBR>co-ordination</NOBR> and maintenance of standards in Higher Education through distance. In the said meeting, it was inter alia decided that the approvals should be granted to the courses and no to the institute.

No inspection of their facilities or infrastructure available at the site was conducted by any authority and the only inspection that was done was confined to checking the documents. Any approval granted without any inspection, satisfaction and recommendation of the AICTE was meaningless. According to him, even assuming that the principle laid down by this Court in <SPAN class="ft134">Bharthidasan </SPAN>(supra) was to apply to Deemed to be Universities as well, the UGC guidelines themselves required the application to be in terms of specifications of AICTE and therefore even if one were to accept that satisfaction of AICTE was not required under the</P>

<P class="p143 ft2">conducted courses and granted degrees without any statutory approvals and</P>
<P class="p143 ft2">in the teeth of numerous public notices. In the face of such blatant misuse,</P>
<P class="p143 ft2">the grant of <NOBR>ex-post-facto</NOBR> approvals was not called for. In his note the</P>
<P class="p143 ft2">learned Amicus Curiae submitted:-</P>
<P class="p144 ft2">“The further issue that arises is as to whether in technical education and other specialized fields, the <NOBR>non-involvement</NOBR> of technical / specialized body is permissible or advisable. There is a difference between open distance learning in general fields and those in specialized fileds. While in <SPAN class="ft19">Bharathidasan </SPAN>(supra), this Court has held that the AICTE has no power of granting approvals to Universities, it nonetheless recognizes the significant role played by the AICTE as a recommendatory / advisory body. This would necessarily mean that before any approvals are given, AICTE recommendation for grant of such approval ought to be obtained. An approval granted without an inspection, satisfaction and recommendation of the AICTE is itself meaningless. Therefore, while the judgment in <SPAN class="ft19">Bharathidasan </SPAN>(supra) has excluded the requirement of approvals from AICTE, the approval of a university or course cannot be granted without the recommendation and satisfaction of all relevant competent bodies. In other words, in the case of distance learning education for general courses, the approval of UGC and IGNOU are required and in the case of specialized technical courses, the satisfaction and recommendation of AICTE or such other specialized body would be additionally called for.”</P>

<P class="p394 ft146"><SPAN class="ft22">(supra) and </SPAN>Association of Management of Private Colleges <SPAN class="ft22">(supra) no operational control could be exercised by AICTE over Universities including Deemed to be Universities. However some sort of cooperation was certainly envisaged in </SPAN>Bharathidasan <SPAN class="ft22">(supra) which was purely in the nature of advisory role for AICTE. He further submitted that power of a Deemed to be University to start new courses was unlimited and a Deemed to be University would be bound by regulatory mechanism only in two ways:-</SPAN></P>
<P class="p398 ft8"><SPAN class="ft2">a.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft137">Its recognition as a Deemed to be University could be withdrawn if it was found to be not functioning within the limits, and</SPAN></P>

<P class="p403 ft14">in a completely different and limited context and the idea was essentially to recognize Deemed to be University for the purposes of funding and that such Deemed to be University is not a University for all purposes. In his submission, if such Deemed to be University is desirous of starting any technical course it ought to obtain express approval from AICTE. He also placed reliance on Section 23 to submit that a University established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a Provincial Act or a State Act alone is entitled to have the word “University” associated with its name which again signified the distinction between a University established or incorporated under a legislation as against a Deemed to be University.</P>
<P class="p340 ft22"><SPAN class="ft2">34.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft92">Thus, we are principally concerned in the present matters with questions regarding validity of degrees in Engineering awarded by the concerned Deemed to be Universities in two periods. a) Where students were admitted during 2001 to 2005 in respect of which </SPAN><NOBR>ex-post-facto</NOBR> approval was granted; and b) In respect of students admitted by JRN during <NOBR>2007-08,</NOBR> <NOBR>2008-09</NOBR> and from <NOBR>2011-12</NOBR> onwards.</P>

<P class="p77 ft14">statutory approvals. It is, however, the submission of Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, learned Senior Advocate that a Deemed to be University is entitled to start new courses in technical education (including through distance education mode) in terms of law laid down by this Court in <SPAN class="ft134">Bharathidasan </SPAN>(supra) and that there was no bar or prohibition in any statute or statutory instrument when the Deemed to be Universities started the instant courses in distance education mode. According to him, the inspections could of course be undertaken by UGC in terms of the Statute and if no inspections, as a matter of fact were conducted, the Deemed to be Universities could not be at fault.

<P class="p108 ft0">93</P>
<P class="p116 ft11"><SPAN class="ft2">36.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft162">The definition of “Technical Education” in Section 2(g) of the AICTE Act shows that the emphasis is on the programmes of education, research and training in Engineering Technology in general and the idea is not limited to the institutions where such programmes of education, research and training are to be conducted or imparted. However, the definition of</SPAN></P>
<P class="p77 ft14">“Technical Institution” in Section 2(h) leaves out an institution which is a University. The distinction between the broader concept of “Technical Education” and the limited scope of “Technical Institution” is clear from Section 10 of the AICTE Act where certain functions concern the broader facets or aspects of technical education which by very nature must apply to every single institution (whether university or not) where such courses are conducted or imparted. At the same time, certain functions are relatable to technical institutions alone, which by definition are not applicable to universities. For example, Functions in <NOBR>sub-clauses</NOBR> (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (l) and (n) are concerned with broader facets of technical education, while functions in Clauses (k), (m), (p) and (q) deal with matters concerning technical institutions and thus may not apply to universities, whereas there are certain functions as set out in Clauses (g) and (o) which apply to both “Technical Institutions” and “Universities” imparting technical education. Clauses (c), (d) and (f) of Section 10 deal with subjects, <SPAN class="ft118">inter</SPAN></P>

<P class="p108 ft0">94</P>
<P class="p77 ft14"><SPAN class="ft118">alia</SPAN>, coordination of the technical education in the country at all levels; promoting innovation, research, development, establishment of new technologies, generation, adoption and adaptation of new technologies to meet the developmental requirements; and promoting and effecting link between technical education and systems and other relevant systems. AICTE is thus the sole repository of power to lay down parameters or qualitative norms for “technical education”. What should be course content, what subjects be taught and what should be the length and duration of the courses as well as the manner in which those courses be conducted is a part of the larger concept of “technical education”. Any idea or innovation in that field is also a part of the concept of “technical education” and must, as a matter of principle, be in the exclusive domain of AICTE.</P>
<P class="p78 ft22"><SPAN class="ft2">37.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft92">In </SPAN><SPAN class="ft146">Bharathidasan </SPAN>(supra) the issue was whether a University established under a State Law, within its area of operation, was entitled to start courses in technical education as an adjunct to the University itself without any approval of AICTE. The requirement of grant of approval under Section 10(1)(k) of the AICTE Act being specific in respect of technical institutions alone, the conclusion was arrived at that the AICTE could not insist upon such grant of approval when a University wished to start courses in technical education as an adjunct to the University itself. The discussion</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_95">


<P class="p0 ft0">95</P>
<P class="p218 ft2">in <SPAN class="ft145">Bharathidasan </SPAN>shows that this Court accepted the role of AICTE in</P>
<P class="p38 ft2">laying down norms and standards in technical education system which is</P>
<P class="p143 ft2">evident from following portions from paragraph Nos.10 and 16.</P>
<P class="p252 ft2">“10………………A careful <NOBR>scanning-through</NOBR> of the provisions</P>
<P class="p350 ft2">of the AICTE Act and the provisions of the UGC Act in juxtaposition, will show that the role of AICTE <NOBR>vis-à-vis</NOBR> the universities is only advisory, recommendatory and a guiding factor and thereby subserves the cause of maintaining appropriate standards and qualitative norms and not as an authority empowered to issue and enforce any sanctions by itself, except submitting a report to UGC for appropriate action………………….</P>
<P class="p142 ft2">16…………We also place on record the statement of the</P>
<P class="p347 ft2">learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, which, in our view, even otherwise is the correct position of law, that the challenge of the appellant with reference to the Regulation in question and claim of AICTE that the appellant University should seek and obtain prior approval of AICTE to start a department or commence a new course or programme in technical education does not mean that they have no obligation or duty to conform to the standards and norms laid down by AICTE for the purpose of ensuring coordinated and integrated development of technical education and maintenance of standards………….”</P>
<P class="p427 ft22"><SPAN class="ft2">38.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft92">Technical education leading to the award of degrees in Engineering consists of imparting of lessons in theory as well as practicals. The practicals form the backbone of such education which is </SPAN><NOBR>hands-on</NOBR> approach involving actual application of principles taught in theory under the watchful eyes of Demonstrators or Lecturers. Face to face imparting of knowledge in theory classes is to be reinforced in practical classes. The practicals, thus,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_96">


<P class="p108 ft0">96</P>
<P class="p77 ft139">constitute an integral part of the technical education system. If this established concept of imparting technical education as a qualitative norm is to be modified or altered and in a given case to be substituted by distance education learning, then as a concept the AICTE ought to have accepted it in clear terms. What parameters ought to be satisfied if the regular course of imparting technical education is in any way to be modified or altered, is for AICTE alone to decide. The decision must be specific and unequivocal and cannot be inferred merely because of absence of any Guidelines in the matter. No such decision was ever expressed by AICTE. On the other hand, it has always maintained that courses leading to degrees in Engineering cannot be undertaken through distance education mode. Whether that approach is correct or not is not the point in issue. For the present purposes, if according to AICTE such courses ought not to be taught in distance education mode, that is the final word and is binding – unless rectified in a manner known to law. Even National Policy on Education while emphasizing the need to have a flexible, pattern and programmes through distance education learning in technical and managerial education, laid down in Para 6.19 that AICTE will be responsible for planning, formulation and maintenance of norms and standards including maintenance of parity of certification and ensuring coordinated and integrated development of</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_97">


<P class="p108 ft0">97</P>
<P class="p77 ft22">technical and management education. In our view whether subjects leading to degrees in Engineering, could be taught in distance education mode or not is within the exclusive domain of the AICTE. The answer to the first limb of the first question posed by us is therefore clear that without the Guidelines having been issued in that behalf by AICTE expressly permitting degree courses in Engineering through distance education mode, the Deemed to be Universities were not justified in introducing such courses.</P>
<P class="p116 ft37"><SPAN class="ft2">39.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft98">We now move to the second limb of the first question. Under 1994 AICTE, Regulations, “no courses or programmes shall be introduced by any Technical Institution, University including a Deemed University or University Department on College except with the approval of the Council”.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p77 ft22"><SPAN class="ft146">Bharathidasan </SPAN>(supra) declared said Regulation to the extent it required a University to have approval for introducing any courses or programmes in technical education, to be bad. Same thought was amplified in <SPAN class="ft146">Association of Management of Private Colleges </SPAN>(supra) to say that affiliated colleges of the University were entitled to the same protection. The question is, whether a Deemed to be University is also entitled to the same protection. The matter can be considered under two categories:-</P>
<P class="p428 ft8"><SPAN class="ft2">a.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft137">The first category could be of a Deemed to be University, which was conferred such status for its excellence in a field of</SPAN></P>

<P class="p0 ft0">98</P>
<P class="p244 ft22">technological subject, is now desirous of introducing courses or programmes integrally connected with the area- in respect of which it was conferred Deemed to be University status. For example, an Engineering College which because of its excellence in the field was conferred Deemed University status, now wishes to introduce courses in subjects like Robotics or Nano Technology which are Engineering subjects and integrally connected with its own field of excellence.</P>
<P class="p429 ft14"><SPAN class="ft42">b.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft165">The second category could be of a Deemed to be University which was conferred such status for its excellence in subjects which are completely </SPAN><NOBR>un-related</NOBR> to the field in which new courses are sought to be introduced. For example an Institution engaged in teaching Fine Arts and Music, for its excellence in that chosen field- or for that matter an institution engaged in teaching Law had been conferred such status. Can such a Deemed to be University claim immunity from regulatory control of AICTE and say that it is entitled, as a matter of right, to introduce courses in Engineering on the strength of the decision of this Court in <SPAN class="ft134">Bharathidasan</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p369 ft2">We are concerned in the present cases with the second category of</P>

Their fields were completely <NOBR>un-related.</NOBR> As a matter of fact, JRN and IASE did not even have regular college or faculty for Engineering at its main campus.

According to the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General, the conferral of status is only because of excellence in a particular field or subject which then entitles the Deemed to be University to utilise its excellence to conduct research and achieve advancement in that field.

However the University would be bound by territorial restrictions, in that it could not go beyond the territory of three Districts over which it was given Jurisdiction. But if we accept the submission of Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, learned Senior Advocate, there would be no such territorial restrictions on a Deemed University and it could open new departments, introduce new courses in any field anywhere in the Country. By way of illustration, we can consider the case of a private institution affiliated to a University such as Bharathidasan University, which after some length of time is conferred Deemed to be University status for excellence achieved by such private institution, say in the field of adult education. If we accept the submission of Dr. Dhavan, upon such conferral of Status as Deemed to be University, this originally affiliated private institution can now introduce any courses in technical education anywhere in</P>

There is no such Charter or grant in favour of a Deemed to be University under any provision of the UGC Act. All that the UGC Act does is to confer Deemed to be University status on an Institution which has achieved excellence in its chosen field so that its development in the concerned field and its attempts to attain excellence and conduct research are not hampered on any count and at the same time it could be extended the facilities of Aid. It is precisely for this that the distinction between a regular University established under a Central Act, a Provincial Act or a State Act and an Institution Deemed to be University is maintained in the UGC Act. A Deemed to be University can certainly award degrees but cannot use the</P>
<P class="p433 ft22">word “University” by virtue of Section 23 of the UGC Act. Even after conferral of such status it still continues to be “an Institution Deemed to be University” and if it is equated with a University in every sense of the term it would lead to incoherent and incongruous results, in that its area of operation or the field of its activity would be completely unlimited and unregulated. In our view that is certainly not the intent of the UGC Act.</P>

<P class="p116 ft14"><SPAN class="ft2">43.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft133">Conceptually there is some difference between the status of a University established under a State law and that of a Deemed to be University. Normally, a University is established with an idea that particular areas or districts of the State need to be catered to. Such University is expected to satisfy the needs or aspirations of people in the area for education and correspondingly empowered to initiate new courses, keeping in tune with the needs of time. The expectations from a Deemed to be University are of a different dimension. What is expected is excellence, research and advancement in its chosen field for which such status was accorded. There is no embargo on such Deemed to be University in entering new areas of education or introducing new courses but in that case, it can’t</SPAN></P>
<P class="p434 ft14">demand or receive complete relaxation from regulatory regime. It must satisfy all those requirements which a normal institution is required to. The stand taken by the UGC in the affidavit of Dr. Ved Prakash, as well as its submissions in our view, are correct and we reject the submission of Dr. Dhavan. The logical conclusion is that a Deemed to be University in the second category mentioned hereinabove is still an institution of the stature of a “technical institution” and if it desires to introduce new courses it must fulfill the requirements of 1994 AICTE Regulations. A Deemed to be University which has achieved excellence in a particular field may be</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_103">


<P class="p431 ft0">103</P>
<P class="p77 ft169">given deferential treatment but nonetheless it has to satisfy the requirements for new technical institution. Pertinently, both JRN and IASE, while establishing their faculty or colleges in engineering at their main Campus sought approvals from AICTE. Further, even for introducing courses in management which come under the definition of technical education under the AICTE Act, appropriate permissions were sought from AICTE. We therefore conclude that the Deemed to be Universities in the present case were required to abide by the provisions of 1994 AICTE Regulations and could not introduce courses leading to award of degrees in Engineering without the approval of AICTE. 1994 AICTE Regulations or any subsequent Regulations will have to be understood in the light of our decision.</P>
<P class="p435 ft22"><SPAN class="ft2">44.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft92">Para 3 of the notification dated 22.11.1991 which constituted DEC shows that there was no representation for any Member or representative of AICTE. The provisions of IGNOU Act show that the Study Centres as defined in the IGNOU Act are that of IGNOU and not of any other University or Institution. The concept of distance education under sub- clause (v) of Section 5 is also in relation to the academic programmes of IGNOU. It undoubtedly has powers under Clauses (vii), (xiii) and (xxiii) to cooperate with other Universities but the IGNOU Act nowhere entitles</SPAN></P>

<P class="p77 ft14">IGNOU to be the Controlling Authority of the entire field of distance education of learning across the Country and in relation to programmes of other Universities or Institutions as well. The Order dated 29.12.2012 issued by MHRD therefore correctly appreciated that DEC created under statute 28 of IGNOU Act could not act as a regulator for other Universities. In any event of the matter, the policy Guidelines issued from time to time made it abundantly clear that DEC alone was not entitled to grant permission for open distance learning and appropriate permissions from the requisite authorities were always required and insisted upon. Despite such policy statements, DEC went on granting permissions without even consulting AICTE. Such exercise on part of DEC was completely without jurisdiction.</P>

<P class="p77 ft14">illegality in the exercise of power was to such an extent that it could not be cured by <SPAN class="ft118">ex post facto </SPAN>approvals granted later. We have also seen that the exercise of grant of <SPAN class="ft118">ex post facto </SPAN>approvals, as a matter of fact, was only superficial and perfunctory. Such exercise was done in the face of declared policy statements governing the field and even when specific complaints were received about concerned Deemed to be Universities. Yet, without causing any inspection such power was exercised which part is already dealt with and the exercise of power has been found by us to be suffering from illegality and infirmity. The only thing in favour of the concerned Deemed to be Universities is the fact that the Joint Committee of UGC – AICTE – DEC had endorsed the decision though such exercise was also completely flawed. That exercise was against Para 10 of the MoU dated 10.05.2007, which contemplated causing of inspections and the decision dated 11.05.2007 of the Joint Committee itself that for an Institution/University to offer distance education programmes it was mandatory to offer the same in face to face mode.</P>
<P class="p115 ft37"><SPAN class="ft2">46.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft98">Having found the entire exercise of grant of </SPAN><NOBR>ex-post-facto</NOBR> approval to be incorrect and illegal, the logical course in normal circumstances would have been not only to set aside such <NOBR>ex-post-facto</NOBR> approvals but also to pass consequential directions to recall all the degrees granted in pursuance</P>

<DIV id="page_106">


<P class="p431 ft0">106</P>
<P class="p77 ft139">thereof in respect of Courses leading to award of degrees in Engineering. However, since 2004 UGC Guidelines themselves had given liberty to the concerned Deemed to be Universities to apply for <NOBR>ex-post-facto</NOBR> approval, the matter is required to be considered with some sympathy so that interest of those students who were enrolled during the academic sessions 2001- 2005 is protected. Though we cannot wish away the fact that the concerned Deemed to be Universities flagrantly violated and entered into areas where they had no experience and started conducting courses through distance education system illegally, the over bearing interest of the concerned students persuades us not to resort to recall of all the degrees in Engineering granted in pursuance of said <NOBR>ex-post-facto</NOBR> approval. However, the fact remains that the facilities available at the concerned Study Centres were never checked nor any inspections were conducted. It is not possible at this length of time to order any inspection. But there must be confidence and assurance about the worthiness of the concerned students. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to grant some chance to the concerned students to have their ability tested by authorities competent in that behalf. We, therefore, direct that all the degrees in Engineering granted to students who were enrolled during the academic years 2001 to 2005 shall stand suspended till they pass such examination under the joint supervision of <NOBR>AICTE-UGC</NOBR> in</P>

It is entirely left to the discretion of AICTE to come out with such modalities as it may think appropriate and the tests in that behalf shall be conducted in the National Institutes of Technology in respective States wherever the students are located. The choice may be given to the students to appear at the examination which ideally should be conducted during May- June, 2018 or on such dates as AICTE may determine. Not more than two chances be given to the concerned students and if they do not pass the test/tests their degrees shall stand recalled and cancelled. If a particular student does not wish to appear in the test/tests, the entire money deposited by such student towards tuition and other charges shall be refunded to that student by the concerned Deemed to be University within a month of the exercise of such option.

<P class="p77 ft14">the concerned Deemed to be Universities by 31.03.2018. If they clear the test/tests within the stipulated time, all the advantages or benefits shall be restored to the concerned candidates. We make it clear at the cost of repetition that if the concerned candidates do not clear the test/tests within the time stipulated or choose not to appear at the test/tests, their degrees in Engineering through distance education shall stand recalled and cancelled. It goes without saying that any promotion or advancement in career on the basis of such degree shall also stand withdrawn, however any monetary benefits or advantages in that behalf shall not be recovered from them.</P>
<P class="p278 ft14"><SPAN class="ft2">48.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft133">As regards the students who were admitted after the </SPAN><NOBR>ex-post-facto</NOBR> approval granted in favour of such Deemed to be Universities, in our view, there was no sanction whatsoever for their admission. The Policy Statements as well as warnings issued from time to time were absolutely clear. The students were admitted on the strength either provisional recognition or on the strength of interim orders passed by the High Court. We therefore, declare that in respect of students admitted after the academic sessions of <NOBR>2001-2005,</NOBR> the degrees in Engineering awarded by the concerned Deemed to be Universities through Distance Education Mode shall stand recalled and be treated as cancelled. Any benefit which a candidate has secured as a result of such degrees in Engineering in the nature of promotion</P>

<P class="p431 ft0">109</P>
<P class="p77 ft14">or advancement in career shall also stand recalled. However, if any monetary benefit was derived by such candidates that monetary benefit or advantage will not be recovered by the concerned departments or employers. We, further direct that the entire amount paid by such students to the concerned Deemed to be Universities towards tuition fee and all other expenditure for such courses through distance education learning shall be returned by the concerned Deemed to be Universities to the respective students. This direction shall be complied with by the concerned Deemed to be Universities scrupulously and the amounts shall be returned by 31<SPAN class="ft13">st </SPAN>of May, 2018 and an appropriate affidavit to that extent shall be filed with UGC within a week thereafter.</P>
<P class="p116 ft14"><SPAN class="ft2">49.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft133">The factual narration mentioned hereinabove makes certain things distinctly clear. The affidavit of Mr. Ved Prakash discloses how permissions were granted to introduce courses in the present cases without any authority. On one hand, the authorities were proclaiming their policy statements and on the other, despite there being complaints, they went about granting permissions. Their conduct and approach is difficult to explain on any rational basis and leaves much to be desired. We are, prima facie of the view that the conduct of the concerned officials needs to be looked into and investigated whether the exercise of power by them was completely genuine</SPAN></P>

<P class="p131 ft28">or colourable. We do not express any final opinion in that behalf but direct the CBI to carry out thorough investigation into the matter and to take appropriate steps after culmination thereof.</P>
<P class="p343 ft14"><SPAN class="ft2">50.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft170">The record further shows that time and again warnings were issued to the concerned Deemed to be Universities. Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, learned Senior Advocate is right in his submission that if a Deemed to be University is not to be found functioning within the limits, its recognition as Deemed to be University could be withdrawn. In our view, the concerned Deemed to be Universities had gone far beyond their limits and to say the least, had violated binding policy statements. Even when they did not have any experience in the concerned field and had no regular faculty or college in Engineering, they kept admitting students through distance education mode. When there was nothing at the core, the expansion was carried at the tertiary levels in brazen violation. The idea was not to achieve excellence in the field but the attempts appear to be guided by pure commercial angle. We therefore, direct the UGC to consider whether the Deemed to be University status enjoyed by the concerned institutions, namely, JRN, AAI, IASE and VMRF calls for any such withdrawal and conduct an inquiry in that behalf. If the concerned Deemed to be Universities fail to return the moneys to the</SPAN></P>

<P class="p431 ft0">111</P>
<P class="p393 ft8">concerned students as directed above, that factor shall also be taken into account while conducting such exercise.</P>
<P class="p432 ft37"><SPAN class="ft2">51.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft47">We must also put on record what we have observed during the course of the hearing and consideration of the present matters. It has come to our notice that many institutions which are conferred the status of Deemed to be Universities are using the word “University”, which in our view is opposed</SPAN></P>
<P class="p386 ft8">to the spirit of Section 23 of the UGC Act. The UGC shall take appropriate steps to stop such practice.</P>
<P class="p116 ft22"><SPAN class="ft2">52.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft92">The present case shows the extent of commercialization of education by some of the Deemed Universities. The commercialization of education seriously affects creditability of standards in education, eroding power and essence of knowledge and seriously affecting excellence and merit. The present case further displays lack of effective oversight and regulatory mechanism for the Deemed to be Universities. The UGC had completely failed to remedy the situation. Serious question has therefore arisen as to the manning of the UGC itself for its effective working. We have already</SPAN></P>
